Paragraph: 5
Problem: we tried to wrapped char with ’ but it didn't parse correctly.
Our solution: We used ' instead to wrap chars in our compiler.

Paragraph: 7
Problem: it is not clear whether we can have an underscore (for readability?) only in rat or also in float and int.
Our solution: In many other languages, underscore is supported in all numerical types (like Java), so our compiler accepts this syntax.

Paragraph: 8
Problem: in the example line 5 {1:1, 2:’c’, 7:3/5, {1:T}}, the last item {1:T} doesn't have a key (or a value)
Our solution: We consider that as a mistake and keep the key value structure for our compiler.
